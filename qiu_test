The items may be stored individually as records in a database or may be elements of a search space defined by a mathematical formula or procedure, such as the roots of an equation with integer variables or a combination of the two. - See more at: http://www.java2novice.com/java-search-algorithms/#sthash.c2TL9lzA.dpuf
